    </div>

    <div class="intro-intent">
        <p>Below are some of my favourite things about you.  The point of this is to emphasise how much you mean to me, 
            explain how highly I think of you and to further express my regret in hurting and losing you from my life.  </p>
        <p id="Warning"><strong>Warning!</strong> Some things I say MIGHT be corny, if you find them corny just laugh it off or skip 
            it if it’s truly unbearable HA!</p>
        <p>PS: Some of these may seem more than friendly, but the fact is that in my heart you’re not <em>just</em> a friend, maybe 
            that means I should care more about my friends but even then, you’re a “special” friend, hopefully you know what 
            I mean. My intentions are as I have outlined.   </p>
    </div>

    <div class="favourite-container">
       <!--1--> <div class="favourite"><p class="favourite-title">Your heart:</p><p class="favourite-content">Arguably my most favourite thing about you. You’re the most affectionate and caring girl I’ve met, and going to uni and hearing about other people’s relationships and just seeing how some people are.  It made me realise how good your heart really is.  I’ll speak about some specific instances of your heart later, because those things happened to be favourites too and I don’t want this to be too long.  But some stuff like you jumping at the opportunity to offer me coffee, saving me chocolates from team huddles, offering to make me a LinkedIn, wanting to watch me train, you’re incredible for that.  I can’t believe I didn’t realise what I had with you until now.  </p></div> <!--1-->
       <!--2--> <div class="favourite"><p class="favourite-title">Your silliness:</p><p class="favourite-content">A close competitor to your heart really but I guess this kind of stems from the heart too? You’re just silly haha.  Whether it’s you head bopping to DnB, randomly making sounds and being stupid, or even when we were in the old cafe and you were recording yourself “clearing up” that <strong>you</strong> abused me, then also recording my butt HAHA.   </p></div> <!--2--> 
       <!--3--> <div class="favourite"><p class="favourite-title">Your humour:</p><p class="favourite-content">Kind of ties in with your silliness I guess because you’re funny by being silly.  But also just telling me random funny stuff, you always put a smile on my face.  </p></div> <!--3-->
       <!--4--> <div class="favourite"><p class="favourite-title">Your brain:</p><p class="favourite-content">You’re smart and it’s always good to know a lawyer! Kind of stitched myself up for losing someone that could help me with my taxes.  But you’re clever and very focused on academics which is really good and inspiring actually.  You make me want to become an academic weapon!</p></div> <!--4-->
       <!--5--> <div class="favourite"><p class="favourite-title">Your lips:</p><p class="favourite-content">Now I won’t go too deep regarding your looks (I don’t want to make you uncomfortable).  But don’t get lip filler seriously your lips are perfect and definitely don’t need it.</p></div> <!--5-->
       <!--6--> <div class="favourite"><p class="favourite-title">Your teeth:</p><p class="favourite-content">Quality hygiene g! Haha but yeah you got good teeth.  </p></div> <!--6-->
       <!--7--> <div class="favourite"><p class="favourite-title">Your nose:</p><p class="favourite-content">Don't get a nose job, you do NOT have Rachel’s old nose.  Your nose is great the way it is, especially when it mimicked my nose scrunches haha.</p></div> <!--7-->
       <!--8--> <div class="favourite"><p class="favourite-title">Your face in general:</p><p class="favourite-content">Now I originally intended to name features like previously but I don’t want to be weird.  So just know you’re really pretty (potentially corny) and you should not be insecure at all.  I’m also glad that you know you don’t need makeup (don’t forget it).  Also you have really nice hair and I’m glad you’re not a girl that thinks she needs crazy colours to look good, you’re just naturally beautiful. </p></div> <!--8-->
       <!--9--> <div class="favourite"><p class="favourite-title">Your health:</p><p class="favourite-content">Maybe a tad weird, but I love that you’re such a healthy person.  I don’t think I’ve ever drank as much water in 3 months as I did working with you haha.  </p></div> <!--9-->
       <!--10--> <div class="favourite"><p class="favourite-title">Feminine:</p><p class="favourite-content">Again I don’t want to be weird but it’s something I admire.  You’re super girly and feminine and I’m glad you embrace that and have a traditional mindset.  Even when you worry about your chipped nails from working, that’s some wholesome stuff.  </p></div> <!--10-->
       <!--11--> <div class="favourite"><p class="favourite-title">How caring you are:</p><p class="favourite-content">Now this is basically your heart but it’s something I want to elaborate on, I know I’ve mentioned things in the Heart section and the Letter, so I hope I don’t repeat myself.  But you are SUPER caring, I remember when you first gave me my birthday present, and I know I’ve told you it meant a lot but boy it meant a lot.  I still have the wrapping and the fact that you went through so much effort for me, it means the world to me.  It’s difficult to put into words but people don’t do what you did, I mean that put it over the top for me and I fell for you completely.  The little moments when we met at work, the fact that you (almost) remembered the time of my last message.  You wanting to go to Tank despite being at the gym, and countless other things I’ve mentioned like coffee, chocolates, socks, as well as things I haven’t mentioned.  I know this is a page about my favourite things about you but damn do I regret a lot.  You are seriously special and one of a kind.  </p></div> <!--11-->
    </div>

    <div class="could-include">
        <p>Now I could name many other things, like your emotional intelligence (you smart smart), your TV show taste, class, you being a strongwoman, a lowkey hater, etc.  But I don’t want this to be <em>too</em> long.  But in summary you are an amazing person and basically a perfect girl, you really mean a lot to me.  I hope it put a smile on your face, thanks for reading.  </p>
