        <h1>Welcome to the website!</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="introduction">
        <p>I’ve been a bad partner and even worse friend, I recognise that. So this website serves as a way to express my remorse and sincerity of my apology because losing you from my life is one 
            of the hardest things I’ve dealt with, especially considering it’s all my fault. So ideally this website helps to show you that I really am sorry even though I’ve probably said it a lot 
            in messages while being rude and disrespectful to you and therefore lost its meaning, I am sorry. It may have been a bad idea but God knows I am horrible at these things, and talking or 
            apologising isn’t really where I shine so hopefully you see my intention. You mean a lot to me, so the website also acts as a commitment to show that I want to do everything I can to 
            keep you in my life and treat you how you deserve. Hopefully, it brings you a smile and you appreciate it. No rush to get back to me at all! Take your time, I’ve been pushy enough!<br></p>
            <p><br>Below are three clickable boxes, two of them will take you to other parts of the website and the one will open a new link and (offer to) take you to spotify.  
                Below each box is a little discription of what you can expect from each page.  At the top of the page there is a navigation bar for easy access.  I hope you enjoy.  
            </p>

            <a href="letter.html" class="button" id="Letter"><p><img src="./resources/Icons/page.svg">Letter</p></a>
            <div class="Letter-description"><p>This letter is me expressing my remorse and doing my best to explain how sorry I am.  I accept that all the things that went wrong were my fault so I 
            take accountability.  Hopefully, it comes across in the way that I intend.  And if it doesn’t I’ll write 100 more!  You’re important to me and I hate 
            that I hurt you, give it a read, I hope it does something good.  </p></div>

            <a href="favourites.html" class="button" id="Favourites"><p><img src="./resources/Icons/bright-star.svg">Favourites</p></a>
            <div class="Favourites-description"><p>A page including some of my favourite things about you.  There’s a message at the top of it that explains my intent.  You mean a lot to me and I 
            think you’re pretty great and I regret a lot of what I did, I hope you have a look, and I hope it puts a smile on your face.  </p></div>

            <div class="Playlist-description"><p>A playlist I made to further express my remorse and how important you are in my life.  The playlist gradually changes themes but listen to it however
             you want.  (I’m still not sure about a lot of the songs but hopefully you get my intention and how it aligns with what’s on the website).  Hope you enjoy it!  (Also you can skip Lana 
             if she still makes you sad, sorry).  </p></div>

        <p>He's a guy that messed up by hurting a girl he cares a lot about.  Talking isn't exactly a strength of his.  He's not sure if this was a good idea
