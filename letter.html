        <p>Dear Avneet,</p>
        <p>Hopefully, this letter demonstrates my remorse but even then the words struggle to convey how sorry I really am.  As I’m writing this I am unsure whether to speak about the specific instances that caused you pain and that I know I was in the wrong, I’ve been in the wrong in all of them.  However I’ve decided not to speak about them (maybe some more recent stuff though), I don’t want to cause you pain or stress more than I already have and I’m sorry if this letter does that (we both know I am horrendous at this stuff).  But I recall every single time where I’ve treated you unfairly (or at least I’ve tried to recall them all, there’s probably been more).  In the last few weeks, I’ve reflected on myself and my actions and how much pain I’ve caused you.  I’ve been disrespectful, cruel and judgemental.  I got upset at the smallest things for no reason whatsoever.  The way I treated you had absolutely nothing to do with you, and I know in the past I’ve even tried to justify myself by saying “Oh but you’ve done this so it caused me to be suspicious” and whatever, that was unfair.  The way I treated you had everything to do with me, I guess I was so worried that it would end in a way that would hurt me, unconsciously I was watching everything you did and looking for the smallest thing that would indicate the potential for something bigger.  What’s worse is that I would be upset about something, visibly show it AND be silent, it’s as if I didn’t care how you felt when I was quiet, as if I didn’t care that you thought bad things about yourself, I don’t think it even crossed my mind, I was just focused on making sure you wouldn’t hurt me.  And that is extremely unfair because, in all of that, I failed to recognise how good of a person you are, I forgot your past and most importantly I forgot how much you cared about me.  This all sounds like the cliche of “it isn’t you, it’s me” but this time it’s very much all me.  The same girl who ordered me a poetry book from my favourite artist, looked everywhere for a specific Friends POP figure only to resort to a POP from my favourite cinematic franchise.  The same girl who even got special wrapping for me, made a Friend’s title for me, bought us matching Friends socks and offered me coffee every opportunity she got.  That very girl I anticipated would hurt me and I judged and overlooked how much you cared.  Words can’t describe how sorry I am.
        <br><br>
        Even being just friends I was probably worse, I was selfish.  I knew I hurt you and again not being concerned for your feelings I was worried if I put you off me so I kept trying to forcefully fix things without thinking of you.  You would tell me how you’ve been feeling and I overlooked it and made it about myself.  I didn’t respect your boundaries or think to realise how rude I’ve been.  I’m sorry for touching your thigh, it may be a bad idea to bring it up but I have to say sorry.  Maybe I’m making it bigger than what it was but what it was was me being extremely disrespectful and not treating you like a lady.  That was disgusting of me, I’m sorry.  Then giving you looks for having a single shot? Again this may have been a bad idea to bring up but this was the worst thing I’ve ever done.  I think back to myself in that moment wondering why I did that and the only conclusion is that I was being manipulative so you would conform in a way that I thought was right (I must’ve lost my mind). I do not want to be that guy ever and I hate that I was that guy that night.  You’re entitled to a bloody shot, especially with how busy you’ve been and how you’ve been feeling.  Again I didn’t care and I just acted out stupidly.  I’m really sorry for that and I don’t want to be that person ever, I’m sure words aren’t enough but know I am truly sorry.  Also, I should’ve rushed to Nandos for you, I’m sorry for that too.  After that night I rushed to reconcile, again not thinking of your boundaries and feelings, whether you needed space or even wanted to see me.  I failed to see how bad I’ve been to you and so I pushed and pushed and pushed some more.  To think I scared you and brought you familiar feelings from your past, that I would do anything like that to you, my heart breaks every day recalling that, I am sorry from the bottom of my heart, again it’s difficult to put into words but I’m really, really sorry.  I failed as a man caring for you (it may sound corny but it’s true).
        <br><br>
        You’ve deserved none of this and to think I’ve reminded you of the worst times of your life even though you fell for me hoping for the very opposite, I hope it hurts me as much as it hurts you.  You deserve the best and I know I haven’t given you that but I want you to know how much you mean to me.  You mean more to me than you may realise.  Even though we haven’t known each other for that long it’s like I forgot how life was before I knew you.  You’re one of the best things that’s walked into my life and I regret losing you from my life.  I broke everything we had because of my fears and selfish reasons and I wish I could just glue it all back together.  Your significance in my life can’t be overstated and you’re constantly on my mind.  So I hope this letter helps and I’ll do everything I can to earn back your trust and forgiveness and have you back in my life.  I’m hopeful that we can rebuild what I ruined and maybe emerge stronger than before.
        <br><br>
        Always here for you,<br>
